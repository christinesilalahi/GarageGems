## Garage Gems

**GARAGE GEMS** is a platform where users can buy and sell recycled or second-hand items that are still in good condition, such as clothing, furniture, and more.

Indonesia is the second-largest contributor to waste in the world, after China. Therefore, we must be more aware of this issue. One of the solutions is to sell recycled or second-hand items.
Many used goods still hold value and can be repurposed or recycled into new items. This effort not only helps reduce waste but also minimizes carbon footprints.
Therefore, **GarageGems** provides a platform for those looking to expand their market and contribute to sustainability through the resale of these items.

The features available on the GarageGems website are:

**GarageGems** is a collaborative project developed by my team and me as part of our **Software Engineering** course.  In this project, we divided tasks among team members to leverage our individual strengths and ensure efficient development. I chose to focus on the backend development, where I worked on creating and managing the server, database, and APIs to support the functionality of the website. We utilized the **Agile development methodology**, allowing us to work iteratively and adapt to feedback and changing requirements throughout the process.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.
